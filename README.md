It is a very basic game right now I still have alot to add to it including some fundamental movement mechanics such as dashing.

You play as Jill who is a food delivery person who needs to get food to EVIT has fast as possible using her roller skates.

The Superintendent has ordered lunch for his staff, and you have been challenged to deliver it to his office in the administration building.

The Player’s (Student) objective is to make it through the EVIT campus to the Administration Building from Bistro 13 where the game starts. The student carries 15 meals and is paid for each meal delivered.

EVIT Security thinks you’re a dangerous intruder and tries to stop you. He or she is armed with a taser and chases after you.

The student loses some energy every time he or she gets tasered. Fortunately, the Student can regain power if they make it into one of the other campus buildings. But that power comes at a price. They must provide a teacher with one meal to get re-charged.

The game’s objective is to reach the Superintendent’s office with as many meals as possible.

The Player is a game asset that displays the number of meals he or she is still carrying. A counter on the screen keeps track of the energy the student has retained.

EVIT Security will try and stop you as you move through campus. They are armed with tasers and are under orders to keep you from reaching the administration building. The student loses some energy every time he or she gets tasered.

Each building has two entrances/exits. Security can’t cover both entrance/exits. There are 10 buildings between the Bistro and the Administration Building.
